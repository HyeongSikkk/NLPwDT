# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

## Introduction
This is a Kaggle competition to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. The dataset is provided by Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data). The dataset contains 7613 tweets that are labeled as either real or not real disaster tweets. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.
